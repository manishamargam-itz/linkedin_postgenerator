  "text": "I have reviewed more than 1000 of resumes and here's what actually makes a good resume!\n🚀 Your Resume is Getting Rejected Before a Human Even Sees It - Here’s Why!\nDid you know? 75% of resumes never reach a recruiter’s eyes. They get filtered out by something scarier than your last job interview - the ATS (Applicant Tracking System).\nMost people make basic mistakes that turn their resumes into invisible job applications. If your resume isn’t getting you interviews, you might be making these career-killing mistakes ⬇️\n🔴 Fancy fonts & excessive formatting – ATS prefers simplicity. Stick to Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Avoid tables, text boxes, or graphics.\n🔴 PDF or Word? – Some ATS systems struggle with docx file. When in doubt, submit a pdf file.\n🔴 Overly creative job titles – 'Chief Happiness Officer' sounds fun, but ATS won’t recognize it. Use industry-standard titles.\n🔴 Lack of keywords – ATS looks for specific skills from the job description. If you’re applying for a Data Analyst role but your resume doesn’t mention ‘SQL’ or ‘Tableau,’ say goodbye to that job. Use keywords smartly!\n🔴 Objective Statements (Nobody Cares 😅) – Replace that ‘Looking for an opportunity to grow’ fluff with a powerful summary of your achievements.\n🔴 Too much personal info – The ATS doesn’t care about your age, gender, or full address. Keep it professional.\n🔴 Your work experience is missing impact – Don’t just list responsibilities. Instead of ‘Handled social media’, write ‘Increased social media engagement by 60% in 3 months.’\n🔴 Unnecessary sections – Hobbies, declarations, personal statements? Nobody cares. Keep it clean & professional.\n🔴 Your resume is full of buzzwords – ‘Hardworking, passionate, dedicated team player’ doesn’t prove anything. Show, don’t tell!\nSo, how do you make your resume ATS-friendly & job-winning?\n✅ Use bullet points – Easier to scan, both for ATS & humans. (12-35 words)\n✅ Mirror the job description – Take important skills/keywords from the job post & weave them into your resume.\n✅ Quantify achievements – ‘Increased sales by 30%’ is stronger than ‘Handled sales.’\n✅ Use standard section headings – Stick to ‘Work Experience’ instead of ‘Journey So Far.’\n✅ File name matters – Instead of ‘Resume_Final_2(1).pdf,’ use ‘John_Doe_DataAnalyst_Resume.pdf’\n✔ Keep it simple & professional – No colors, images, charts, or fancy designs. The ATS won’t read them.\n✔ Add relevant certifications & skills – ATS ranks resumes higher if they include industry-specific skills.\nA good resume gets you an interview. \nA bad one? Doesn’t even get past the robot :)\nAll the best!",

  "text": "Not even 100 days ago, I was lying on a hospital bed…\nTears in my eyes.\nFear in my chest.\nAnd a loud silence in my mind.\nI wasn’t recovering from surgery.\nI was recovering from something harder to explain - anxiety attacks and depression.\nNo visible scars. But inside, I was shattered.\nI was drowning in emotions I didn’t have names for.\nSome days I couldn’t get out of bed.\nSome days I avoided calls just because I couldn’t fake a smile.\nSome days I genuinely thought… maybe this pain will never leave me.\nBut the most painful part?\nFeeling like I was too much for this world.\nToo emotional. Too silent. Too sensitive. Too “difficult.”\nAnd yet - here I am today.\nTravelling. Breathing. Laughing.\nThis is my second trip in years.\nI took my first one in April - after what felt like forever.\nAnd now, I’m slowly finding myself again.\nHealing hasn’t been magical. It’s been messy.\nI still get triggered. I still get anxious.\nBut now, I know how to hold my own hand when I fall.\nAnd I owe a huge part of that to Mahadev and spirituality.\nIn moments of darkness, it was faith that kept me going.\nThe belief that this pain, too, had a purpose.\nThat I was being broken only to be rebuilt.\nThe silence of prayer.\nThe strength of surrender.\nThe reminder that I’m never truly alone.\nTo anyone out there silently struggling with anxiety or depression:\nYou are not alone.\nYou don’t have to rush your healing.\nYou don’t need to justify your sadness.\nYou are allowed to take time, to rest, to begin again.And to those who stood by me, even when I didn’t know how to ask for help -\nThank you. Your kindness saved me in ways words never can.\nPlease, be kind. Always.\nSomeone out there is fighting battles you cannot see.\nThis post is not about a trip -\nIt’s about courage.\nIt’s about survival.\nIt’s about hope.\nWith folded hands,\nThank you, Mahadev.\nThank you, life.\nI’m coming back. One breath at a time.\nJo toot kar bikhar jaaye,\nWahi toh sach mein sanwarti hai.\nWith gratitude,\nMuskan",
