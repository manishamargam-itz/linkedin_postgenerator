        "text": "I have reviewed more than 1000 of resumes and here's what actually makes a good resume!\n\ud83d\ude80 Your Resume is Getting Rejected Before a Human Even Sees It - Here\u2019s Why!\nDid you know? 75% of resumes never reach a recruiter\u2019s eyes. They get filtered out by something scarier than your last job interview - the ATS (Applicant Tracking System).\nMost people make basic mistakes that turn their resumes into invisible job applications. If your resume isn\u2019t getting you interviews, you might be making these career-killing mistakes \u2b07\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd34 Fancy fonts & excessive formatting \u2013 ATS prefers simplicity. Stick to Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Avoid tables, text boxes, or graphics.\n\ud83d\udd34 PDF or Word? \u2013 Some ATS systems struggle with docx file. When in doubt, submit a pdf file.\n\ud83d\udd34 Overly creative job titles \u2013 'Chief Happiness Officer' sounds fun, but ATS won\u2019t recognize it. Use industry-standard titles.\n\ud83d\udd34 Lack of keywords \u2013 ATS looks for specific skills from the job description. If you\u2019re applying for a Data Analyst role but your resume doesn\u2019t mention \u2018SQL\u2019 or \u2018Tableau,\u2019 say goodbye to that job. Use keywords smartly!\n\ud83d\udd34 Objective Statements (Nobody Cares \ud83d\ude05) \u2013 Replace that \u2018Looking for an opportunity to grow\u2019 fluff with a powerful summary of your achievements.\n\ud83d\udd34 Too much personal info \u2013 The ATS doesn\u2019t care about your age, gender, or full address. Keep it professional.\n\ud83d\udd34 Your work experience is missing impact \u2013 Don\u2019t just list responsibilities. Instead of \u2018Handled social media\u2019, write \u2018Increased social media engagement by 60% in 3 months.\u2019\n\ud83d\udd34 Unnecessary sections \u2013 Hobbies, declarations, personal statements? Nobody cares. Keep it clean & professional.\n\ud83d\udd34 Your resume is full of buzzwords \u2013 \u2018Hardworking, passionate, dedicated team player\u2019 doesn\u2019t prove anything. Show, don\u2019t tell!\nSo, how do you make your resume ATS-friendly & job-winning?\n\u2705 Use bullet points \u2013 Easier to scan, both for ATS & humans. (12-35 words)\n\u2705 Mirror the job description \u2013 Take important skills/keywords from the job post & weave them into your resume.\n\u2705 Quantify achievements \u2013 \u2018Increased sales by 30%\u2019 is stronger than \u2018Handled sales.\u2019\n\u2705 Use standard section headings \u2013 Stick to \u2018Work Experience\u2019 instead of \u2018Journey So Far.\u2019\n\u2705 File name matters \u2013 Instead of \u2018Resume_Final_2(1).pdf,\u2019 use \u2018John_Doe_DataAnalyst_Resume.pdf\u2019\n\u2714 Keep it simple & professional \u2013 No colors, images, charts, or fancy designs. The ATS won\u2019t read them.\n\u2714 Add relevant certifications & skills \u2013 ATS ranks resumes higher if they include industry-specific skills.\nA good resume gets you an interview. \nA bad one? Doesn\u2019t even get past the robot :)\nAll the best!",

Too silent. Too sensitive. Too \u201cdifficult.\u201d\nAnd yet - here I am today.\nTravelling. Breathing.

It\u2019s been messy.\nI still get triggered. I still get anxious.\nBut now, I know how to hold my own hand when I fall.\nAnd I owe a huge part of that to Mahadev and spirituality.\nIn moments of darkness, it was faith that kept me going.\nThe belief that this pain, too, had a purpose.\nThat I was being broken only to be rebuilt.\nThe silence of prayer.\nThe strength of surrender.\nThe reminder that I\u2019m never truly alone.\nTo anyone out there silently struggling with anxiety or depression:\nYou are not alone.\nYou don\u2019t have to rush your healing.\nYou don\u2019t need to justify your sadness.\nYou are allowed to take time, to rest, to begin again.And to those who stood by me, even when I didn\u2019t know how to ask for help -\nThank you.
